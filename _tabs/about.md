Watt’s the Point is a platform dedicated to exploring the energy transition in Great Britain, with a focus on the engineering, policy, and market mechanisms shaping the journey to a low-carbon future. The site aims to demystify the complexities of the energy industry; breaking down how the system works, where greenhouse gas emissions come from, and how emerging technologies are changing the way energy is generated, transported, and consumed.

Through clear explanations and evidence-based analysis, Watt’s the Point bridges the gap between technical detail and everyday relevance. A core goal of the site is to empower consumers by showing how individual choices, such as how and when energy is used, can have a tangible impact on both household bills and carbon emissions. By making energy more understandable and accessible, Watt’s the Point helps readers engage more confidently with one of the most important transitions of our time.
