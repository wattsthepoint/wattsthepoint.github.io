## Assumptions and simplifications

The calculator above aims to aid the assessment of the running cost-saving potential of an electric vehicle (EV). It makes various assumptions and simplifications to balance effort with accuracy. The default values are an example based on 03/02/2026 using the Octopus 12-month fixed tariff for the current tariff/standing charge (which is intended to be the tariff for electricity without an EV) and the Intelligent Octopus Go tariff for the EV tariff. 

The reason general electricity usage is included in the calculations is that the day tariff for an EV tariff is generally marginally higher, meaning that although a car can be charged very inexpensively overnight, other hours for normal usage are more expensive, slightly reducing overall savings. It is assumed that all general electricity usage is during peak hours and all EV charging is during off-peak hours.

## Other considerations

The cost of running EVs is well known to be lower than that of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, utilising diesel or petrol, due to their high efficiency. There are many variables to consider before making the switch, though. A switch to an electric vehicle requires a charger to be installed, where charging is to be done at home, which is typically installed for [£949 or more](https://octopus.energy/ev-charger-faq/). Where long journeys are to be made, and charging is required at public chargers, this is normally at a premium; the higher the frequency this is required, the lower the benefit of an EV. There are often insurance cost differences between EVs and traditional vehicles due to their inherent high-performance. Many electric vehicles fall into the luxury car tax bracket, which an equivalent conventional vehicle may not, meaning that an additional premium may be required.
